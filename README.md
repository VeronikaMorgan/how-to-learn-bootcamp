#First-project  
-----  
###*Simple one-page webside, created for a practice*  

####the Usage of BEM at the level of HTML, as well as first try of BEM-nested. Basic application of transitions and animations.  
#####Need to make it more flexible and adaptive later, at least to change a height and width, so that every section would cover the whole viewport. Want to work on scroll too, so that it would have one step right for one section.
